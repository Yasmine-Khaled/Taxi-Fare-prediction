# Taxi-Fare-prediction
 Taxi Fare prediction aims to predict taxi fares in New York City based on various features such as pickup and drop-off locations, distance, and other relevant factors. The predictive model is built using machine learning techniques to assist taxi users and drivers in estimating fares for their journeys.
